### 3. Configure Authentication Providers

1. Review and update options in `auth.ts` as needed.

2. When setting up OAuth, in the developer admin page for each of your OAuth services, you should configure the callback URL to use a callback path of `{server}/api/auth/callback/{provider}`.

e.g. For Google OAuth you would use: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

A list of configured providers and their callback URLs is available from the endpoint `api/auth/providers`. You can find more information at https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/oauth-tutorial

1. You can also choose to specify an SMTP server for passwordless sign in via email.

### 4. Start the application
