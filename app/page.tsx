      <p>
        a person who hoards things. - „I’m a bit of a hoarder" someone who
        collects large amounts of something and keeps it for themselves, often
        in a secret place. - „He was one of those hoarders who can't throw
        anything away.“

        And just like a hoarder in real life, is this smart contract collecting
        everything. You show him a NFT he wants to have it. Have some nice
        shinny coins, he wants to buy them from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever the hoarder got <u>he will not give back.</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sick of burning your coins? Just sell them to the hoarder and he will
        keep them forever.

        On a more serious note, this is a tool that allows you tax loss
        harvesting. Tax loss harvesting is a method to collect the losses that
        you made and make them tax deductible.
